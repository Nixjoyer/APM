# Arch Package Manager (APM)
This is a package manager I thought I'd make after getting tired of constantly going back and forth to the official AUR website to check for a particular package. This is kind of a continuation of the ARP script but with it's own key differences.

Now, in as much as I test and use each version, I cannot guarantee that it'll work as intended 100% of the time so do monitor the operations it does when running the script.
 
# How to use


# Disclaimer
As stated before, all the scripts are AI generated so there may be a few errors and inconsistences across different versions as I add, remove and refine different parts of the script. This is why I've also shared each and every version and iteration of the script so in the event that one of the scripts breaks you can just use a previous version.
